The distribution contains generated data. If you want to contribute
please hack your way directly via the repository mentioned in the
`_oasis` file.

For developing, you will need to install [uucd][1] and download a copy
of XML Unicode character database to $DBPATH. From the root directory
of the repository type:

    ln -s $DBPATH data/ucd.xml
    ./build data

The result is in `data/data.ml`, it contains the definitions from
`data/defs.ml` and the data extracted from the Unicode character
database via the program `data/extract_data.ml`. 

The file `data/data.ml` is ignored by the version control
system. During the construction of the distribution, the data file is
generated and its content is directly substituted in `src/uunf.ml`,
see `unicode_data()` in the `build` script.

For the `./build test` target to work download the
`NormalizationTest.txt` file from the Unicode character database to
$TESTPATH and from the root directory of the repository type:

    ln -s $TESTPATH data/test.txt
    ./build test
