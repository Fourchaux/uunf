The distribution contains generated data. If you want to contribute
please hack your way directly via the repository mentioned in the
`_oasis` file.

For developing, [uucd][1] and a copy of the XML Unicode character
database are needed.

Let `DBPATH` be the location of the XML Unicode character database. From
the root directory of the repository type:

    ln -s DBPATH data/ucd.xml
    ./build data

The result is in `data/data.ml`, it contains the definitions from
`data/defs.ml` and the data extracted from the Unicode character
database via the program `data/extract_data.ml`. 

The file `data/data.ml` is ignored by the version control
system. During the construction of the distribution, the data file is
generated and its content is directly substituted in `src/uunf.ml`,
see `unicode_data()` in the `build` script.
